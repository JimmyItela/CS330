1. How do I approach designing software?

Throughout this project, I learned to approach software design with a structured and iterative mindset. The development of my 3D scene required breaking complex tasks—such as lighting, texture mapping, and camera movement—into smaller, testable components. I began with pseudocode and UML diagrams to visualize system flow before writing actual code.

My work improved my understanding of modular design, where classes like SceneManager, ShaderManager, and ViewManager handled specific responsibilities. This helped me manage complexity and debug issues efficiently. I also developed stronger skills in code reusability and abstraction, ensuring each component could be extended for future enhancements.

In future projects, I plan to reuse this process—starting with clear design documentation, building prototypes, testing incrementally, and continuously refining. This approach ensures flexibility and maintainability across all software projects.

2. How do I approach developing programs?

Developing my 3D scene taught me to think like both a programmer and a visual designer. Early development focused on implementing geometry and transformations using OpenGL, while later stages emphasized applying textures and lighting for realism. I frequently iterated based on visual feedback, adjusting shader code and texture coordinates until the results matched the design goals.

I applied agile-style iteration, where each milestone introduced new features such as camera controls, object shading, and texture integration. Debugging became part of my learning—each challenge with lighting or file paths revealed more about how the rendering pipeline operates. Over time, my approach evolved to be more experimental and data-driven, using systematic testing and documentation to track changes.

This method helped me see programming not only as syntax but as a creative process, merging analytical logic with artistic expression.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Studying computer science, especially in the area of computational graphics and visualization, has strengthened both my technical and creative goals. The knowledge I gained from this project—working with shaders, transformations, and rendering pipelines—directly supports my long-term interests in interactive visualization, multimedia systems, and audio-visual technology integration.

These skills can be applied to multiple pathways, from game development to real-time simulation and even advanced audio-visual system design. The ability to create visually accurate 3D environments enhances my problem-solving ability and provides a bridge between technical programming and artistic design.

Ultimately, computer science gives me a foundation to turn creative concepts into interactive digital experiences. It aligns with my career goals by enabling me to combine my passions for software engineering, sound, and visual media into cohesive, technology-driven projects.
